# How to organize your repo

1. Name it after project codename.
2. On the default branch keep your last valid version of the application (it means buildable, ready-to-use in the module, and tested).
3. Start developing new functionality on new branch created from main.
4. Save your progress by committing changes and pushing to remote.
5. When you finish development, mark it on Electronics & Software's Trello board by moving the card to “Verifying” list.
6. Open a pull request.
7. Then inform the team on the channel about the ready-to-review code and send them the link to your PR.
8. When PR gets approval merge it to main.
